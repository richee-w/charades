# Game of Charades

Charades is a game where players act out a word or phrase without speaking, while their team tries to guess what it is. This repository contains two programs to help you play the game.

## Requirements
The programs in this repository are written in Python 3. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system before running them.

## gui-charades.py
This program offers a choice of 5 items for the player to act out. The team has two minutes to guess the correct answer, or you can set your own time limit. After the first round, click “Generate another 5 Items” to get a new set of choices. Future rounds are played in the same way.

## charades.py
This is a proof of concept version that is text only. It outputs one item for the player to act out and then immediately closes. To get another item, simply run the program again.

Have fun playing Charades!

## Dependencies
The program has 3 dependencies: plain text files called songs.txt, tv.txt, and movies.txt. Make sure these files are present in the same directory as the program before running it.
